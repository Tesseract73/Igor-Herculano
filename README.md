# Hey there! I’m Igor

### About Me
I’m a Marketing graduate (since 2011) with a lifelong passion for creativity and technology. Now, I’m starting a new chapter in my professional journey. After a hiatus to focus on a spiritual project, I’m returning to the workforce with a fresh perspective and a big goal: learning to code.

### My Journey
- **Background**: Marketing taught me that everything revolves around understanding users’ needs — I’m excited to bring this insight into tech.  
- **Current Focus**: Transitioning into the world of programming, starting with beginner-friendly languages like Python.  
- **Challenges**: Now, nearing 40 (born May 10, 1985), I’m overcoming the fear of the unknown, one line of code at a time.  

### What I’m Working On
- Learning the basics of programming (Python, HTML/CSS, and more to come).  
- Experimenting with small projects that blend Marketing and tech — stay tuned for updates!  
- Building confidence through practice and exploration.

### Let’s Connect
I’m here to learn, grow, and collaborate. Feel free to reach out!
